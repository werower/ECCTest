# ECC Encryption
 
Java and JavaScript examples of mutual Elliptic Curve Encryption (ECC). 

AES symmetric key is generated using Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman(ECDH) key agreement. 

Java part of this example uses Bouncy Caste cryptography library. Public and Private keys are saved in JKS keystore. Public Key in X509 format with a self-signed 
certificate. 

Web part uses SubtleCrypto API. Public and private keys are saved and loaded from IndexedDB.
